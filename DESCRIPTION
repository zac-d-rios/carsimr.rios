Description: This package allows users to simulate movement for very simple 
    cars. Blue cars move upward if unimpeded and red cars move the right if 
    unimpeded. The cars wrap around when they get to the top or right, 
    respectively. Additionally, the package allows users to visualize this process
    through generics plot.carsimr and plot.carsimr_list.
