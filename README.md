The goal of carsimr.rios is to simulate car movements for various
different car densities, while also allowing the user to visualize these
movements.

## Installation

You could install the development version of carsimr.rios, if it were
public, from [GitHub](https://github.com/zac-d-rios/carsimr.rios) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zac-d-rios/carsimr.rios")
```

## Example

This is an example of how to initialize a grid, first with a proportion
and then with an integer number of cars

``` r
library(carsimr.rios)
example1 <- initialize_grid(0.5, c(5, 3), 0.7)

example2 <- initialize_grid(8, c(5, 3), 0.5)

example1
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    0    2    1
#> [2,]    0    0    2
#> [3,]    0    0    2
#> [4,]    2    1    0
#> [5,]    2    2    0
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "carsimr"
```

``` r
example2
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    0    2
#> [2,]    2    0    1
#> [3,]    1    2    0
#> [4,]    1    0    2
#> [5,]    0    0    0
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "carsimr"
```

Notice how they both have the same number of cars, but with a different
proportion of blue cars (represented by 2). Specifically, example1 has
about 70% blue cars, while example2 has about 50%.

For moving the cars, use the move cars function, which takes a carsimr
object and number of iterations to move.

``` r
move_cars(example2, 2)
#> [[1]]
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    0    2
#> [2,]    2    0    1
#> [3,]    1    2    0
#> [4,]    1    0    2
#> [5,]    0    0    0
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "carsimr"
#> 
#> [[2]]
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    0    0
#> [2,]    2    2    1
#> [3,]    1    0    2
#> [4,]    1    0    0
#> [5,]    0    0    2
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "carsimr"
#> 
#> [[3]]
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    0    1    0
#> [2,]    2    2    1
#> [3,]    0    1    2
#> [4,]    0    1    0
#> [5,]    0    0    2
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "carsimr"
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "carsimr_list"
```

Notice how blue cars (2â€™s) moved upwards during the first move, and red
cars moved rightwards during the second move.

Shown below is an example of plotting the movements of cars through
various iterations

``` r
plot(move_cars(initialize_grid(rho = 0.3, c(5, 5), p = 0.5), trials = 5))
#> [1] "Simulation Complete"
```
